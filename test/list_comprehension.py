"""
Given a list of N numbers, use a single list comprehension to produce a new list that only contains those values that
are:
(a) even numbers, and
(b) from elements in the original list that had even indices

For example, if list[2] contains a value that is even, that value should be included in the new list, since it is also
at an even index (i.e., 2) in the original list. However, if list[3] contains an even number, that number should not be
included in the new list since it is at an odd index (i.e., 3) in the original list.

a = [2,3534,43,43,24,65,7,2]
answer = [2,24]

print([x for x in a[::2] if x%2==0])

"""
A simple solution to this problem would be as follows

[x for x in list[::2] if x%2 == 0]
For example, given the following list:

#        0   1   2   3    4    5    6    7    8
list = [ 1 , 3 , 5 , 8 , 10 , 13 , 18 , 36 , 78 ]

the list comprehension [x for x in list[::2] if x%2 == 0] will evaluate to:

[10, 18, 78]

The expression works by first taking the numbers that are at the even indices, and then filtering out all the odd numbers.
