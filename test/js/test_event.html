Benefits:

Simplifies initialization and saves memory: no need to add many handlers.
Less code: when adding or removing elements, no need to add/remove handlers.
DOM modifications: we can mass add/remove elements with innerHTML and alike.


The delegation has its limitations of course:

First, the event must be bubbling. Some events do not bubble. Also, low-level handlers should not use
event.stopPropagation().
Second, the delegation may add CPU load, because the container-level handler reacts on events in any place of the
container, no matter if they interest us or not. But usually the load is negligible, so we don’t take it into account.

What are the pros and cons?
The benefits of JavaScript event delegation are:

There are less event handlers to setup and reside in memory. This is the big one; better performance and less crashing.
There’s no need to re-attach handlers after a DOM update. If your page content is generated dynamically, via Ajax for
example, you don’t need to add and remove event handlers as elements are loaded or unloaded.
The potential problems may be less clear, but once you are aware of them they’re easily avoided:

There’s a risk your event management code could become a performance bottleneck, so keep it as lean as possible.
Not all events bubble. The blur, focus, load and unload events don’t bubble like other events. The blur and focus events
can actually be accessed using the capturing phase (in browsers other than IE) instead of the bubbling phase but that’s
a story for another day.
You need caution when managing some mouse events. If your code is handling the mousemove event you are in serious risk
of creating a performance bottleneck because the mousemove event is triggered so often. The mouseout event has a quirky
behaviour that is difficult to manage with event delegation.
